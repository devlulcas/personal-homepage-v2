<p align="center">A really simple project with some features that I use everyday</p>

## ✨ Objective
Build a homepage to be used in my own browser, instead of the default one with a todo list built-in and other cool features that I find useful.

## 🔧 How to get it working
#### ❗First of all: All of your data is going to be stored in your localStorage, only in your computer.❗

Almost everything comes ready out of the box, but you gonna need to add a custom configuration to make your weather app works.
- Click in the gear icon in the weather section. <br>
- Add an [Weather Bit Api Key ](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) that you can get for free in their website <br>
- Add your country code <br>
- Add your state name <br>
- Add you city name <br>
- Press the green button <br>
- All done :D <br>

#### All the website is displayed in brazilian portuguese, but maybe someday I add an feature to translate it to other languages as well...
